You look through the window of the cabin and see a small kitchen. There's some blue fur stuck in the drain, and cherries dotted around the cutting board. Faint sounds of a radio can be heard further in.

You move to look through another window, a strange blue creature you can't exactly make out is laying on a couch listening to the radio. The floor is decorated by a large neon pink carpet and the walls boast a purple wallpaper.

You ball up a fist and strike them in the face, an audible squeak is heard as your fist meets their eyes. They grab the door and attempt to slam it closed.
